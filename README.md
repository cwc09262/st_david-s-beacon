**Saint David’s Beacon** traces Psalms across texts, especially within the Orthodox Christian tradition. Named after the prophet St. David, the project uses technology to illuminate the Psalms’ spiritual significance and deepen understanding.


## Background
The Bible frequently references itself in countless ways, yet no definitive catalog exists that fully maps these interconnections. In *The Russian Religious Mind*, George P. Fedotov devotes a section to Byzantium and its hymnography, writing:

> “The poetic structure of Byzantine hymnology is an organic blending of Jewish and Greek artistic forms. The Psalms and Homer … contributed to a common store of images and rhetorical means.”

Inspired by this insight, I am developing a program that traces references to the Psalms across Christian texts — not through exact quotations, but through thematic resonance.

 Within the past few years, I have been drawn towards specifically the beauty and nature of the book of Psalms. I have been wanting to find something that I have a real passion for and apply to my ever growing knowledge and abilities within computer science. After taking a Machined Learning class, I was able to further understand and see the capability of ML and more specifically start to investigate **Natural Language Processing**. 	


This project lays the groundwork for something greater: a system that reveals how deeply the Bible, and particularly the Psalms, shape Christian worship, theology, and even our daily lives. A familiar example can be found in the Divine Liturgy of the Orthodox Church:

### The Psalms in the Divine Liturgy

- **The First Antiphon**: excerpts from Psalm 103, beginning with  
  *“Bless the Lord, O my soul.”*

- **The Second Antiphon**: excerpts from Psalm 103, including  
  *“Praise the Lord, O my soul.”*

As I study these Psalms more closely, I see how they are continually reinterpreted, rephrased, and lived out in the faith of the Orthodox Church. Their beauty inspires me, and their recurrence invites deeper exploration.

While traditional Bible tools are excellent at identifying direct quotations, they are limited to matching exact words. My website aims to go beyond this — using modern tools like semantic search and machine learning to find **thematic echoes** of the Psalms wherever they appear.

In doing so, I hope to shed light on the enduring spiritual legacy of these sacred songs.


## Using St. David's Beacon

Just like Google, this tool can be used to find Psalms related to references in relation to major themes or questions in the Christian faith, such as suffering, praise, or divine justice. The main things to search should be common themes withing the Church or quotes from the Divine Liturgy. Below are some of the queries that I have found to give great results. 

- "*For the Peace of the world*"
- "*love*"
- "*guide*"
- "*For the abundance of the fruit of the Earth*" 

I want to also want you make you aware that not every search will produce results, and that is ok. There is some provided information on more ways to refine a search. I tried my best to make understandable for everyone. With all this being said i invite you to explore it for yourself and try to find results intriguing to you. Please reach out with any findings or questions you may have. I would love to talk and meet you if i do not already know you.
