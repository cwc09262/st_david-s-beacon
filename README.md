**Saint David’s Beacon** traces the presence of the Psalms across texts and other mediums within the Orthodox Christian tradition. Named after the prophet and psalmist St. David, this project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to uncover and illuminate references to the Psalms throughout sacred and spiritual writings.


## Background
The Bible frequently references itself in countless ways, yet no definitive catalog exists that fully maps these interconnections. In *The Russian Religious Mind*, George P. Fedotov devotes a section to Byzantium and its hymnography, writing:

> “The poetic structure of Byzantine hymnology is an organic blending of Jewish and Greek artistic forms. The Psalms  . . . contributed to a common store of images and rhetorical means.”

Inspired by this insight, I have developed a search engine that traces references to the Psalms across Christian texts — not only through exact quotations, but also thematic resonances.

 Within the past few years, I have been drawn towards the beauty of the book of Psalms. I have also been trying to find a project that incorporates my computer science background with the Orthodox Church in some way. After taking a Machine Learning class, I was able to further understand and see the capability of ML and more specifically start to discover and learn about **Natural Language Processing**. Motivated by a desire to explore the beauty of the Psalms and inspired by my recent discovery of Natural Language Processing, I set out to build a search engine capable of tracing the Psalms across Orthodox texts—bringing together my spiritual interests and technical skills.
 
This project lays the groundwork for something greater: a system that reveals how deeply the Psalms, shape Christian worship, theology, and even our daily lives. A familiar example can be found in the Divine Liturgy:

- **The First Antiphon**: excerpts from Psalm 103, beginning with  
  *“Bless the Lord, O my soul.”*

- **The Second Antiphon**: excerpts from Psalm 103, including  
  *“Praise the Lord, O my soul.”*



While traditional Bible tools are excellent at identifying direct quotations, they are limited to matching of exact words or phrases. My search engine aims to go beyond this — using modern tools like semantic searching and machine learning to find **thematic echoes** of the Psalms. In doing so, I hope to shed light on the enduring spiritual legacy of these sacred Psalms.


## Using St. David's Beacon

Just like Google, this tool can be used to find Psalms related to references in relation to major themes or questions in the Christian faith, such as suffering, praise, or divine justice. The main things to search should be common themes withing the Church or quotes from the services. Below are some of the queries that I have found to give great results. 

- "*For the Peace of the world*"
- "*love*"
- "*guide*"
- "*For the abundance of the fruit of the Earth*" 

I want to also want you make you aware that not every search will produce results, and that is ok. There is some information provided on more ways to refine a search. I tried my best to make understandable for everyone. With all this being said i invite you to explore it for yourself and try to find results intriguing to you. Please reach out with any findings or questions you may have. I would love to talk and meet you if i do not already know you.
