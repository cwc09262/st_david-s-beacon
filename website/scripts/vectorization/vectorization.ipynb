    "# TF-IDF: A Foundation of Information Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to begin the Psalm retrieval website and model, we need to work on the basics of information retrieval. This will be accomplished using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**, a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (the corpus). Once this is finished, we will have vectors that can be used for comparisons later during the information retrieval process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF represents two different calculations that, when combined, result in a score for each word in a given document within a set of documents. The entire calculation is composed of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "TF-IDF = Term\\ Frequency\\ (tf) * Inverse\\ Document\\ Frequency\\ (idf)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "Before beginning, we should note some terminology. Here are some of the most common terms and variables used within this project:\n",
    "- **t** - The targeted word within a document.\n",
    "- **d** - A document or a set of words.\n",
    "- **N** - The number of documents in the corpus.\n",
    "- **corpus** - The collection of all documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TF - Term Frequency\n",
    "This measures the occurrence of a word within a document. The equation to calculate this is:\n",
    "\n",

    "The inverse document frequency represents how informative a word is within the document collection.\n",
    "\n",

    "IDF measures how important a term is across a collection of documents. It is calculated as:\n",

    "## Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming the process of transforming all words into their root. This ensures that similar words are treated the same. As an example, **cooking something** and **cooked something** are pretty much the same thing in terms of the action to cook something. Without any cleaning or processing, these words would be treated as three separate things: `cook`, `cooked`, and `cooking`. This could prevent a document from being retrieved if the query does not contain the exact form of the word `cook`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using stemming, we convert different variations of a word into its root form, improving search accuracy and consistency in text analysis. There are a couple of different stemmers we can use, and will be outlined below. \n",
    "### Porter-Stemmer\n",
    "This stemmer targets and identifies affixes and suffixes of words and removes them. From the NLP text book, referenced above, it says this is a good stemmer for searches because of the indexing it does and the support it gives for searches, using alternative forms of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lancaster-Stemmer\n",
    "The Lancaster Stemmer works to reduce words to their root form. It is more aggressive than other stemmers, such as Porter Stemmer, meaning it can sometimes over-stem words, reducing them to very short roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the textbook [Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/), we are given examples of both stemmers. After reading about both in the text, we are going to use the `Porter-Stemmer` for our data. This will be best for information retrieval. \n",
    "\n",
    "> This code is some of my own and line two came from pages **107 - 108** in the textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lemmatization\n",
    "This is a similar method to reduce words to their root word. The difference is found in the output. Within lemmatization, the word is only reduced to its root word if and only the root word exists. This still is a very useful mitigation to treat all variations of a single word as the same thing. Below is a table to illustrate the difference between **Stemming** and **Lemmatization**.\n",
